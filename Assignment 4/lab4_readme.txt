3) Analysis: if service time is set to 5 (sec/min), I noticed that
it's hard to determine which is more efficient as the wait time isn't 
heaveier for most simulations. If the program were to be run 10 times, 
the wait time distribution is almost equal for the 2 different
queues. 
Whereas as the service time is increased few folds as seen in real world, 
multi-queue system was seen to be faster. However there are other factors 
to take into account: switching lanes in multi-queue. The program assumes
customers remain in the chosen queue. As this causes messy queues in reality
I believe the experiment conducted is a good way to deduce the best queue
system for a real bank service.
